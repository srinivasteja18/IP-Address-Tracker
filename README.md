 IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This app locates the IP address and points the location in map. To get the IP Address locations, I used the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, I used LeafletJS which is an open-source JavaScript library.
